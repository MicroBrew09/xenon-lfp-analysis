# xenon-lfp-analysis
This is an interactive GUI for analyzing for bandpass filtered (1 to 2048 Hz) LFP activity and seizure-like actiivty. This GUI is built in Python using Plotly's Dash library for interactive visualizations, this includes several features to generate summary measures, plots, trace LFP activity over time, and for people familiar with basic Python this can also serve as a boiler plate to customize, add functions and visualization based on individual researchersâ€™ analysis requirements. We demonstrate the utility of this data pipeline with induction of seizure-like activity and generating example LFP raster plots over time and space, along with example traces from subregions of the brain. This bird's-eye view of LFP activity within the GUI creates a new tool for investigation into novel insight into network dynamics such as how neocortex and hippocampus interact with each other over space and time. We provide this new python-based software tool, customizable solution for analysis and tracking of local field potential activity using the 3Brain MEA recording system but it can easily be adapted to any MEA recording platform. This GUI is also easily adaptable to large-scale EEG recordings and likely can provide a useful mapping tool for in vivo LFP activity.  Our current GUI has a particular utility for analysis of seizure-like activity but can be used for analysis of any network LFP signal.
